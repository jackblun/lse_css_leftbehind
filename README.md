# lse_css_leftbehind
Work on LSE CSS Hackathon Left Behind Challenge as part of LSE's first computational social science hackathon. For more info see https://www.cssatlse.com/.

Our analysis attempts to answer the following questions:
 -  What are “Rust Belt” regions?
 -  What are shared characteristics across “Rust Belt” regions?
 -  Can we predict “Rust Belt” status?
 -  What is the applicability of the US “Rust Belt” model across different international contexts?
